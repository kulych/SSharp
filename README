School assignment for CPP course

Let’s create a very simple programming language called S# that works as follows:
    All expressions are valued as unsigned 64bit integers, if you write a number 123 it means exactly a 64-bit unsigned 123.
    You can combine the integers using operators +, -, *, /, %, <, >, ==, !=, prefix ~, && and ||, and group them using parentheses. E.g. (1+2)==(5+6) should be valued 0. All operators work just as in C except for ~ which means logical negation, booleans are represented as 0 and 1.
    Several expressions can be connected using ; and grouped using braces {} to form a single expression. “Value” of the expression is the value of the last expression in the braces (similarly as in Scheme or R)
    There is a conditional expression called if which you can use to run conditional code: if (expression) {...} {...}. The ‘else’ branch must always be present, and the parentheses and braces { } are mandatory.
    There is a special expression write(expression) which prints out the value of an expression to the standard output
    There is a special expression read() which reads a value from the standard input and returns it
    You can define your own functions:
        Definition looks like this: functionName paramA paramB {expression}. In the definition, values paramA and paramB are accessible as ‘variables’. (Their values are perfectly constant thorough the function execution, though — there is no assignment). Note that the braces { } around the function definition are mandatory.
        Function call is done using the functionName just as with read or write — you put the expressions with the values for the parameters in parentheses behind the functionName and separate the parameters using a comma ,.
    The program is, as usual in C-style languages, formed by a list of function definitions, and gets ‘executed’ by evaluating the parameter-less function main. Last value in main is used as a return value for the whole program.
    All identifiers (function names and variable names) are made only of alphabetic characters (i.e. variable name param_1 is invalid for 2 different reasons).
    Whitespace between separate tokens is ignored.


Sample sources:

Binary search, INPUT 0 is <, 1 is >, 2 is =

S# source:
bins l r ans {
	if(l==r-1) {
		write(l)
	} {
		if (ans == 0) {
			write((l+(l+r)/2)/2);
			bins(l, (l+r)/2, read())
		} {
			if (ans == 1) {
				write((r+(l+r)/2)/2);
				bins((l+r)/2, r, read())
			}
			{
				if (ans == 2) {
					write((l+r)/2)
				} {
					write(9999)
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
main {
	write(50);
	bins(1, 101, read())
}

Result:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

typedef uint64_t u;

u _ssharp_write(u _input) {
	 printf("%lu\n", _input);
}
u _ssharp_read() {
	u _tmp;
	scanf("%lu", &_tmp);
	return _tmp;
}
u _ssharp_bins(u _ssharp_l,u _ssharp_r,u _ssharp_ans) {
	 return ((((_ssharp_l==(_ssharp_r-1))) ? 
	(_ssharp_write(_ssharp_l))
	 : ((((_ssharp_ans==0)) ? 
	(_ssharp_write(((_ssharp_l+((_ssharp_l+_ssharp_r)/2))/2)),_ssharp_bins(_ssharp_l,((_ssharp_l+_ssharp_r)/2),_ssharp_read()))
	 : ((((_ssharp_ans==1)) ? 
	(_ssharp_write(((_ssharp_r+((_ssharp_l+_ssharp_r)/2))/2)),_ssharp_bins(((_ssharp_l+_ssharp_r)/2),_ssharp_r,_ssharp_read()))
	 : ((((_ssharp_ans==2)) ? 
	(_ssharp_write(((_ssharp_l+_ssharp_r)/2)))
	 : (_ssharp_write(9999))))))))));
}
int main() {
	 return (_ssharp_write(50),_ssharp_bins(1,101,_ssharp_read()));
}
